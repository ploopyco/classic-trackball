# Ploopy BTU Mod

The roller bearings used in the Ploopy Trackball are nice, but with the standard ball they might not feel as smooth or as low-friction as you'd like. The prompt for this mod was "what if we replaced them with ball transfer units?"

It turns out - good things happen!

Ball transfer units (or BTUs) are omnidirectional bearings, as opposed to the single-direction roller bearings the Ploopy Trackball uses by default. This means you're never rolling the ball in the "wrong direction" for one of them.

This mod is a new 3D-printable top piece for the Ploopy which contains holes for ball transfer units instead of roller bearings.

## Versions
### v3
This version was designed in Rhino and so isn't really editable for most people. It works well though.

### v4
This version was redesigned in FreeCAD and the various dimensions are now editable in the FreeCAD file.

Currently untested! It might collide with something internally, particularly if you've soldered in a programming header for the microcontroller.
